You must install the XBS Code Data management module (CDM) prior to installing EUVAT. 
You can find this at http://xoobs.net

Install the EUVAT module as per any normal Xoops module. 
Copy files into modules/xbsvat directory.
Install via the Xoops module administration screen.

For additional help and instructions on using EUVAT, point your browser at 
the docs/index.html file for the systems documentation pages.

NB
******
If you are installing this module on Xoops V2.2.x then don't forget to set the module order to 0 (zero) in modules admin to prevent a menu option appearing on the user side menu.  This is part of a workaround for Xoops 2.2.
